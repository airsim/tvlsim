Summary:
--------
DSim aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as
a C++ library, of a travel market simulator, focused on revenue
management (RM) for airlines. That library uses the Standard Airline IT
C++ object model (http://sf.net/projects/stdair).

%{name} makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.


Getting and installing from the Fedora/CentOS/RedHat distribution:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just use Yum:
yum -y install dsim-devel dsim-doc

You can also get the RPM packages (which may work on Linux
distributions like Novel Suse and Mandriva) from the Fedora repository
(e.g., for Fedora 16, 
http://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/releases/16/Everything/)


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone ssh://dsim.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/dsim/dsim dsimgit
cd dsimgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * stdair-devel, trademgen-devel, travelccm-devel, airsched-devel,
  * airrac-devel, rmol-devel, airinv-devel, simfqt-devel
  * boost-devel
  * zeromq-devel
  * readline-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel (optional)
  * doxygen, ghostscript, graphviz and tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (dsim*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=267805

To customise the following to your environment, you can alter the path
to the installation directory:
export INSTALL_BASEDIR=/home/user/dev/deliveries
export LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE="-DLIB_SUFFIX=64"

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/dsim-0.1.0 \
   -DWITH_STDAIR_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/stdair-stable \
   -DWITH_TRADEMGEN_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/trademgen-stable \
   -DWITH_TRAVELCCM_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/travelccm-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRSCHED_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airsched-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRRAC_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airrac-stable \
   -DWITH_RMOL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRINV_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airinv-stable \
   -DWITH_SIMFQT_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/simfqt-stable \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON \
   ${LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE} ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libdsim*.so*) and the binary (dsim),
  just type:
  make install
  cd ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}
  rm -f dsim-stable && ln -s dsim-0.1.0 simcrs-stable
  cd -
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the (HTML and PDF) documentation:
  make package
* To run the local binary version:
  ./dsim/dsim -b
* To run the installed version (the first following lines must be done once
  per session only):
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/stdair-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airsched-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airrac-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airinv-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/simfqt-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/simcrs-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/dsim-stable/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/simcrs-stable/bin/dsim -b
