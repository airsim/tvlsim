Summary:
--------
The Travel Market Simulator project aims at providing reference implementation,
mainly in C++, of a travel market simulator, focusing on revenue management (RM)
for airlines. It is intended to be used for applied research activities only:
it is by no way intended to be used by production systems. It is a new breed of
software and aims to become the new generation PODS (http://podsresearch.com/),
which was instrumental in the inception of the Travel Market Simulator project.

Over a dozen components have been implemented and are fully functional,
encompassing for instance (but not limited to) traveller demand generation
(booking requests), travel distribution (GDS/CRS), low fare search (LFS),
price calculation and inventory availability calculation), customer choice
modelling (CCM), revenue management (RM), schedule and inventory management,
revenue accounting (RA).

The Travel Market Simulator can used in either batch or hosted mode. It is
the main component of the Travel Market Simulator:
http://www.travel-market-simulator

That project makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the Boost (C++
Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The TvlSim component itself aims at providing a clean API and a simple
implementation, as a C++ library, of a travel market simulator, focusing
on revenue management (RM) for airlines. That library uses the Standard
Airline IT C++ object model (http://sf.net/projects/stdair).


Getting and installing from the Fedora/CentOS/RedHat distribution:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just use Yum:
yum -y install tvlsim-devel tvlsim-doc

You can also get the RPM packages (which may work on Linux
distributions like Novel Suse and Mandriva) from the Fedora repository
(e.g., for Fedora 16, 
http://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/releases/16/Everything/)


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone ssh://denis_arnaud@git.code.sf.net/p/tvlsim/code tvlsimgit
cd tvlsimgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * stdair-devel, trademgen-devel, travelccm-devel, airsched-devel,
  * airrac-devel, rmol-devel, airinv-devel, simfqt-devel, sevmgr-devel
  * boost-devel
  * zeromq-devel
  * readline-devel, ncurses-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel (optional)
  * doxygen, ghostscript, graphviz and tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (tvlsim*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=267805

To customise the following to your environment, you can alter the path
to the installation directory:
export INSTALL_BASEDIR=/home/user/dev/deliveries
export LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE="-DLIB_SUFFIX=64"

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/tvlsim-99.99.99 \
   -DWITH_STDAIR_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/stdair-stable \
   -DWITH_TRADEMGEN_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/trademgen-stable \
   -DWITH_SEVMGR_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/sevmgr-stable \
   -DWITH_TRAVELCCM_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/travelccm-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRSCHED_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airsched-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRRAC_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airrac-stable \
   -DWITH_RMOL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRINV_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airinv-stable \
   -DWITH_SIMFQT_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/simfqt-stable \
   -DWITH_SIMCRS_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/simcrs-stable \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DENABLE_TEST:BOOL=ON -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON \
   -DRUN_GCOV:BOOL=OFF ${LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE} ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libtvlsim*.so*) and the binary (tvlsim),
  just type:
  make install
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the (HTML and PDF) documentation:
  make package
* To browse the (just installed, if enabled) HTML documentation:
  midori file://${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/tvlsim-99.99.99/share/doc/tvlsim-99.99.99/html/index.html
* To browse the (just installed, if enabled) PDF documentation:
  evince ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/tvlsim-99.99.99/share/doc/tvlsim-99.99.99/html/refman.pdf
* To run the local binary version:
  ./tvlsim/tvlsim -b
* To run the installed version:
  ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/tvlsim-99.99.99/bin/tvlsim -b
