<b>Do not ask what TRAVELCCM can do for you. Ask what you can do for
TRAVELCCM.</b>

You can help us to develop the TRAVELCCM library. There are always a
lot of things you can do:

- Start using TRAVELCCM
- Tell your friends about TRAVELCCM and help them to get started using it  
- If you find a bug, report it to us. Without your help we can never hope to
produce a bug free code. 
- Help us to improve the documentation by providing information about
documentation bugs 
- Answer support requests in the TRAVELCCM discussion forums on
SourceForge. If you know the answer to a question, help others to
overcome their TRAVELCCM problems.
- Help us to improve our algorithms. If you know of a better way (e.g. that
is faster or requires less memory) to implement some of our algorithms, then
let us know.
- Help us to port TRAVELCCM to new platforms. If you manage to compile
TRAVELCCM on a new platform, then tell us how you did it.
- Send us your code. If you have a good TRAVELCCM compatible code, which you can
release under the LGPL, and you think it should be included in TRAVELCCM, then
send it to us.
- Become an TRAVELCCM developer. Send us an e-mail and tell what you can do for
TRAVELCCM.
