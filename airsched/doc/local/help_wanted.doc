<b>Do not ask what AirSched can do for you. Ask what you can do for
AirSched.</b>

You can help us to develop the AirSched library. There are always a
lot of things you can do:

- Start using AirSched
- Tell your friends about AirSched and help them to get started using it  
- If you find a bug, report it to us. Without your help we can never
hope to produce a bug free code.
- Help us to improve the documentation by providing information about
documentation bugs 
- Answer support requests in the AirSched discussion forums on
SourceForge. If you know the answer to a question, help others to
overcome their AirSched problems.
- Help us to improve our algorithms. If you know of a better way
(e.g. that is faster or requires less memory) to implement some of our
algorithms, then let us know.
- Help us to port AirSched to new platforms. If you manage to compile
AirSched on a new platform, then tell us how you did it.
- Send us your code. If you have a good AirSched compatible code,
which you can release under the LGPL, and you think it should be
included in AirSched, then send it to us.
- Become an AirSched developer. Send us an e-mail and tell what you
can do for AirSched.
