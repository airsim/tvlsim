airsched - C++ Airline Schedule Manager Library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <airsched/...>
.SH DESCRIPTION
That project aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for processing airline schedules. That library uses
the Standard Airline IT C++ object model
(http://sf.net/projects/stdair), which gathers a collection of
routines for travel market simulation. The routines are written from
scratch by the AirSched team in C++, and present a modern Applications
Programming Interface (API) for C/C++ programmers, allowing wrappers
to be written for very high level languages.
