	  C++ Distributed Airline Market Simulator

\section sec_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <dsim/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

DSim aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as
a C++ library, of a travel market simulator, focused on revenue
management (RM) for airlines.

DSim makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the Boost
(C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The library covers the following areas:
- Demand (booking request) generation
- Schedule (flight-periods) parsing and management:
  travel solution finding
- Inventory (flight-dates) parsing and management:
  availability calculation and sell management
- Pricing
- Customer Choice Model (CCM)
- Distributed airline inventories
- Codeshare and alliances
- Revenue Management (RM)
- Simulation
